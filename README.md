# PokerGame
A very simple poker game

This is a very simple poker game where there are no small blinds, big blinds and other fancy stuff. The cards in the table are dealt like the real game ("burning" the fourth and sixth cards), but despite of what it says, it doesn't take all wins, I'll work on that later. Also, the computer bets are random following a probility list I created (it never bets more than 50 chips) and I'll work on that when I learn enough about poker odds and machine learnig or decision trees or something like that.

This is my very first big project in Python and I'm fairly happy with the result! Even though it is not exactly complete nor very clean...
